The desks make it so all of us students are nicely separated in our own little spacious cubicles but we can still see each other. We're all struggling with homework and I think this environment makes the schoolwork stress feel less worse. I'm trying to finish my coding homework and my math homework (both are due tonight) before 5 because I'm going to eat pho later with my friends. Speaking of eating pho with friends, I am very excited for that later. The friends who invited me, Makayla and Aylin, are people who I hung out with all of the time last quarter. They are pretty much my first college friends. I stopped talking to them in Winter quarter because I felt that I was the only one putting the effort in trying to hang out and just be friends. Well, they proved me wrong by inviting me to eat and I feel honored. I also invited my other close college friends Rebecca and Chenny. Finally, I am listening to music and it makes math so much more fun."

YogurtLand is just always fun to go to Picking different flavors of frozen yogurt and random toppings is great. Traveling back to campus was also pretty funny since it was super packed like always. I actually like when the bus is extremely filled because it's the only time where no one is uptight about personal space; all anyone cares about is getting home. So I find it funny how close everyone is even though we're all strangers. I'm just going to go to Rebecca's room right now to watch My Big Fat Greek Wedding."

               "text": "I went to church with my friend Aylin today. The weather was veerryyy nice today too. I don't usually go to church with my family anymore because we're all too lazy, tired, and busy. My mom used to make us go to church every Sunday when I was younger but that was before she started working. Here at college, however, I'm actually motivated to go. I grew up Catholic and I want to make it part of my identity. I sometimes don't feel super connected to religion but I felt really connected to the church community today. My friend, Aylin, and the usual Latina UCSC girls got off at the bus stop in front of the church. We all walked together every other Sunday and into the church. We all have our own friend groups but there's still connection between us, I think. During the service, I was feeling really bored. There was one prayer that got me thinking critically about my religion. The priest said \"Pray for humanity. Pray for world peace\". I thought, \"For how many years have we been praying for this? When will our prayers actually make a difference in the world?\". Then I started thinking about the book Life of Pi. Even though religious stories seem unprovable, crazy, and just impossible, having hope and faith, to me, is much better than dealing with cruel realities. I like believing that there's some higher being that looks down at me. I like thinking that believing and hoping can create a positive difference in the world. Anyway, I'm at the Stevenson Computer Lab right now with Rebecca and Paul. Paul just got here so I haven't really interacted with him. I'm listening to music and surfing the web which is always fun. I ran into a coding bootcamp website, CodingDojo; the founder wrote an article explaining his students' progress in his program. Apparently, in the first few weeks of the programs, the CS majored or experienced students advance faster than the students with little to no coding experience. After a month, however, most novice students begin to progress in the same pace as the experienced coders. After two months, most novice students even excel as the top students of the classes. The founder then concluded that anyone can learn how to code as long as they have: persistence, the right teachers, and the right learning environment. This has really motivated me because lately, I've felt that my pursuit of obtaining a CS degree is hopeless. I don't understand complicated concepts in my Java class right now. After this article and browsing the CodingDojo website, however, I feel like I can do anything now (as cheesy as that sounds). Finally, the highlight of my day is feeding the Crown Provost kitty. I think I finally got him/her to trust me; it purrs against me now. I felt really bad leaving it but I really have to finish my schoolwork."

               "text": "Paul and I decided to go to McDonald's and try the new Grand Mac burger. We took the bus down there and the burger was GREAT. To be honest, the size of the Grand Mac was basically a regular size Big Mac from 10 years ago. Maybe the burger just looked bigger to me as a kid but the Grand Mac size wasn't really shocking to me now. Anyway, we were trying to take the bus back to the Stevenson computer Lab but 2 buses passed us because they were so packed. Paul and I decided to start walking to bus stops closer to the Santa Cruz Metro Station to get a better chance of catching the bus. We walked about 7 blocks to another bus stop along the Cabrillo Highway but another full bus passed us one again.So far we had been waiting for a bus for 30 minutes; Paul suggested that we walk all the way to the Metro Station. Fist we walked blocks along the Cabrillo Highway and then we cut through residential streets. The lights, restaurants, and hotels along the broadway were definitely exciting and beautiful. Walking through the dark suburban streets was very scary; especially since the houses looked very Halloweeny. We also had to walk through a dark alleyway leading down to a flight of stairs. After managing to get out of there, we were about 5 blocks from Downtown. Paul and I joked and laughed through our entire 2 hour journey which was awesome. Although we walked for a long time, I had a great time. Plus, I think we burned all of the calories from the Grand Mac meal."

I hadn't gone once and I starting to feel really guilty about wasting my money and not keeping up my promise to lose weight this year. Today I only had one class in the morning so I had more than enough time to attend a class. I almost did not go but I pushed myself in the morning to have my gym gear ready to go straight to the OPERS gym after my class. I attended Circuit Xpress around noon and man do I feel GREAT. I never understood why people actually liked exercising until now. It was definitely hard, especially since I currently weight the heaviest I've ever been, but we worked out everything in our body. We did cardio and strength using weights; I realized how weak I am, especially in my left arm. I could barely do anything with my left arm. I feel so awake after this workout an I feel so motivated to work on my body to get better at these exercises. Also, I don't feel hungry at all for \"bad\" foods. I'd much rather eat fruit and drink water right now, which I am. I feel disgusted right now towards meat, potatoes, pasta, etc. I will definitely try to come every day to a fitness class."

My adviser sent me information about the Facebook University for Engineering internship. I truly want to participate in this internship because it is targeted towards minority computer science majors who are just starting to code. This would really help me experience coding in a real work environment and my coding skills would vastly improve. Unfortunetly I am very lazy and forgetful.

SRA's deadline to turn in our materials to our advisors was on February 13 (which I forgot about), so I am trying to complete my essay right now. The essay prompt seems simple but it's so difficult to start it. I don't know how  I should go about the essay.

We did a lot of exercises aside from punching and kicking a punching bag which was fun. I'm still very out of shape Also, the teacher was very handsome which made the class more fun. After working out, Rebecca and I met with Chenny to eat at the College 9 & 10 Dining Hall; the food was alright. Afterwards, we were going to walk back to Merrill College together. I suggested taking the shortcut through the woods; I thought I knew my way around the shortcut already. Unfortunately, I was wrong. We all walked in the pitch black forest with locked arms and the flashlights of our phones turned on. I heard a strange noise in the woods and immediately screamed. All of us were crawling up a hill to get back to College 9 & 10 when we saw a group of guys who were going to take the shortcut too. They laughed at us and were kind enough to let us follow them across the shortcut. We made it! It was hilarious how scared we were."

Also, it's pouring rain: not a good sign for my midterm. I'm also carrying my big backpack, my luggage (I'm going home today for the three day weekend), and an umbrella. Then I went to my Math 19A TA to ask for help on some homework problems to prepare for the midterm today. I can't believe it (or remember clearly) but I fell asleep while he was guiding me through a specific problem that I asked for. I woke up with him helping another kid in the room and I was so confused. I feel super bad for doing that to him but I really was very tired. I felt that I needed to take a quick nap before the midterm so I decided to go to Paul's apartment to rest on his couch. Also, his roommate bought me sushi last night so I want to devour that. When I got to his apartment I wasn't very tired anymore since I had to go through the rain carrying my stuff. Also, Kresge College is basically on a little hill which was very hard to cross with so much baggage. Paul made me some coffee which I chugged (this really woke me up) and his roommate and his roommate's girlfriend are apparently in my Math 19A class. We are going to walk altogether to class (luckily through a shortcut that they know so I don't have to struggle too much)."

I have rainboots on so I was just happily splashing around in the giant puddle of water while I hear groans and complains from people with regular shoes on.

Thinking I was going to be waiting at the bus stop for hours didn't exactly help my mood at the time. After about 15 minutes of waiting and talking with the guy, the extra buses finally came and I found a window seat just for me. I relaxed, listened to music, and fell asleep. I didn't want to arrive home tired and groggy; I wanted to arrive awake and ready to bond with my family. Taking the Caltrain was my favorite; I always sit on the left side of the train because I love seeing the cities across the Peninsula. They remind me a lot of my childhood. When I arrive at San Bruno, my mom picked me up and we drove home together to South San Francisco: home sweet home. I really enjoyed the meal she prepared for me-pollo relleno with special green sauce-and I loved seeing my entire family again, including my kitten Vera."

Then we went to see the house for rent that interest my mom; it's a long shot house but we love looking at new possible homes. Then we went to my high school to pick up an unofficial transcript; it was great to see my old school, the principle, and the secretaries there. Then we went to Walgreens to buy some things that we needed; I got a neat makeup case that will definitely help me travel easier! My mom also got me these sweet red lipsticks that I definitely be using this week. Then we went to my mom's loan place; I like going here because everything is so neat and officey looking and everyone is so professional and friendly.

I'm here because April said that the Stevenson provost owns 3 cats and one of them hangs around the library all day while interacting with students. Being a cat lover, I of course walked down my big hill at Merrill to Stevenson to meet this cat. She is ADORABLE. She's a fluffy black cat who is not shy around humans at all. She's very friendly, cuddly, and just plain cute. I carry cat treats around with me since another cat lives with the Crown provost and I like to deed it every now and then; this cat goes crazy for my treats. It's like she hasn't eaten all day. Having this cat here is very therapeutic. All the students love her and she takes away the stress that we feel because of school.  Walking around Stevenson was also fun. Today is a beautiful, sunny day an I never took the time to walk around this college. It's huge! I also saw Hank the turkey while I was lost looking for the Stevenson library."

It was a weird experience going to a church ceremony in English; I'm so used to listening it in Spanish. Nevertheless, I felt great afterwards. I was surprised seeing how many and which students arrived to the ceremony; I would think that most people here would be aethiests. I could actually understand what the father was saying and I feel super motivated to better myself in the next 40 days. Hopefully I will stick to abstaining from desserts and pizza like I promised after the 40 days of Lent. Another promise that I made to God is to try to be more patient and nice to people. I can get irritated easily with people, even friends. I saw a quote in Rebelde (Mexican telenovela) that basically said \"If you try to keep on looking for flawless friends, you will spend the eternity alone\". I felt that that quote really resonated with me because over the years, my sensitiveness has driven away all of the friends I used to have. About sophomore year is when I started picking at and judging all of my friends' flawed traits. I then decided that I deserved more than those type of friends. Now I realize that there is no perfect friend. If I enjoy someone's company and they enjoy mine, what more can I ask? I will be working on this particular flaw of mine and working to be healthy again. \n\nAfter the service, I ate dinner with Krystal and Paul at Stevenson/ Cowell Dining Hall which was fun. I hadn't seen Krystal in over  a week. \n\nNow I'm at the Stevenson library and I will be doing an all nighter to finish my research paper for my writing class. I really wish I had worked on this much earlier. I'm already beginning to get tired. Fortunately, Boo the cat is still at the library being her cute self."

               "text": "There were a lot of difficulties before the internship interview. First, Eileen was running late and I didn't know if I should have taken the initiative to call her myself since she said that she would be the one calling me. Then, she emailed me saying that she could not reach me through Google Hangouts. I tried to video call her then but she still said that it wouldn't work, sounding a little irritated. She persisted in me just calling her through her phone number. Since there is no phone service at the McHenry library, I had to run up the stairs, go outside, set up my laptop to look at my resume and cover letter, and and call Eileen as fast as possible. I got very nervous throughout the interview but I was fortunately able to answer her questions correctly. There were some rough patches in the interview but overall I believe there was a connection. I know that 100 other students are applying and that there is a lot of heavy competition but I'm still staying optimistic. I walked around McHenry to the forest bridge and the patio to feel more comfortable talking through the phone. The beautiful scenery also comforted me. \n\nAfter the interview, I immediately called my mother to get some motherly love and support. My whole family was eating dinner at that moment so I got to speak with everyone as if I was having dinner with them. It felt great to \"be with my family\" after suffering such a stressful week. Hopefully next week will be much better and I will be able to catch up with all of my work this weekend."

               "text": "Yesterday while walking from the ARC Center to McHenry library, I was distracted from my phone while walking down the stairs and I missed 2 or 3 steps and immediately fell. It happened so quick that I don't really remember falling but I do remember sitting at the bottom of the stairs while feeling extreme pain in my left ankle; I wanted to quickly get up and walk it off to avoid having people see me on the floor but I seriously could not get up. I decided I would sit there until I could get up; I was trying to find a way to look as casual as possible but it was obvious that I was hurt. A guy was walking towards me and I wanted to disappear so bad. I was hoping he would be a jerk, ignore me, and keep on walking but stopped and asked: \"Are you okay? What happened? Can you move your ankle? Is it sprained or broken? Where are you headed? May I help you walk there? May I help you get up at least?\". I could not believe how nice this dude was. I was able to finally move my ankle so I accepted his arm and tested my ankle by jumping up and down. I thanked him a lot and we went our separate ways. Even though my ankle is extremely swollen since yesterday afternoon, this memory really boosts my mood because it reminds me how good people in this world can be. \n\nRight now I'm with Rebecca at the McHenry library listening to music and trying to get some work done. I really don't want to have deal with the consequences of procrastination. I slept for a good amount of hours and ate a good meal so I am in a great mood right now."

I'd give a +2 b/c I'm restoring myself, but not completely restored. Sleep: Miraculously, I slept somewhat heavily, though not long enough, so only +1 on mood. Whatever fixed them, my arms are fine. Exercise: A little worried that I haven't exercised yet; it's vital if I expect to sleep. But I'm still recuperating, so I kept my level at zero.       A note on the request that I start engaging in more activities that will improve my mood --- it's correct to assume that I do that anyway. Last night I listened to classical music, which I save for especially bad days, and it helped. At the same time, the request has alerted me to the probability that I spend too much time in revery.

Could have slept better or worse. Custom 1: -1 b/c this morning I was thinking about how every major family event seems to include some \"crushing\" insult to me. For example, one of my aunts (I only met her once as a child) just died and it looks like my dad delivered the news to me and my siblings via email. He made anonymous my siblings' email addresses. My siblings and I are very estranged, and for personal reasons, I have good reason to believe that the addresses were coded so that I wouldn't contact my brothers. Personally I think my brothers are irresponsible to shut me out. But, maybe I'm biased. At least according to one of his songs, my little brother spent his savings on a girlfriend, and so I'm confused about my role as a female, and whether my brothers and father expect me to date/marry for money so that they can avoid examining their own life choices."

By the time I had done my last lesson I had gotten much better at getting the kids to focus, and even completing extra tasks with them. Therefore, I feel as though that positively effected me. Also, because I was teaching kids all day I am pretty low on energy. On top of that I had to go to class until late as soon as I got back so I am quite tired. I did not manage to get much (if any) relax time today, so that was a bit of a bummer. I also have a big project due tomorrow that is most definitely stressing me out."

I also had French tutoring and the people are generally nice in there, but we had a Composition today in class and I don't think I did very well. People asked me how I think I did and I don't really like talking about it, but I've learned that avoiding the question makes you not as approachable. I'm still hungry."

Well for me it is. Boosted my mood quite a bit. Oh, oh! I finally finished Sophie's World! Now I can start reading another book or two. I also saw Irene on the bus and we chatted a bit, she complimented my outfit and it was nice. On the way to the bookstore I passed Kelsey, looking all frazzled as usual, but her person inspires a certain sense of endearment. I made a funny face at her and she laughed. Now I'm in the library about to do the philosophy readings for today and possibly read something for fun."

Then Valeria told me about the boy that makes her happy and about boundaries and I'm glad she talked to me.

Furthermore, my mom is mad at me because she says I'm not communicating with her enough and ignoring her. As a Latinx female student, a lot of emphasis is placed on family and making decisions to stay near the family and be nurturing and caring. I don't have time for any of that and my mom doesn't understand it. She doesn't understand college or what I do--for her college seems to be a breeze and it's partially due to the fact that she never finished school. Our relationship right now seems fractured and that is devastating because all I want is support, to be independent, and to attain all of my goals."
